Grammar matrix v 0.5, August 15, 2003 (dpf)

This is a minor upgrade of version 0.4 of the grammar matrix, with
some further normalization of relation names and MRS feature geometry
to be consistent with the Copestake et al.  paper, "Introduction to
MRS", being readied for publication.

If you have already developed a grammar based on the matrix, you may
need to make some manual adjustments to your language-specific grammar
files, depending on whether you have made explicit reference to the
affected features or types, which have been changed as follows:

(1) Deleted feature

    The feature E-INDEX was introduced into the Matrix for v 0.4,based 
    on its use in the ERG at the time for treating the semantics of 
    predicative PPs and gerunds.  However, improved analysis of English 
    has removed the current motivation for this attribute in HOOK, so 
    it has been deleted from the Matrix in order to be consistent with 
    the emerging MRS documentation.

(2) Renaming of type 'mrs-thing', and changes to its subtypes

    The name of the supertype of 'individual' and 'handle' has been 
    renamed from 'mrs-thing' to 'semarg' (for 'semantic argument').  
    Also, one of its subtypes 'expl-ind' has been deleted, since it was 
    confusingly redundant with the type 'event-or-ref-index'.  
    Corresponding adjustments have been made to the type hierarchy under 
    'semarg', though the leaf types remain the same.

(3) Renaming of other relations

    To support a more consistent naming convention for relations, any 
    relation or predicate whose name formerly ended in "-rel" now has a 
    name which is like the previous one except that the hyphen ("-") is 
    always replaced with an underscore ("_").  An explanation of the 
    naming conventions can be found in the Matrix User Guide.
