HOW TO USE THIS FILE:

  When you add something, put in the date and identify yourself.
  Prefix each item with feat: (a feature request), bug: (a bug), or
    misc: (anything else).
  When you fix something, mark it DONE:


[10/4/2006 sfd]

feat: Improve TDL pretty-printing
feat: Make TDLfile handle DOTTED.NAME.FORMAT correctly
bug:  Fix layout oddities when the main-page dropdown buttons are clicked
      (by using images?)
bug:  TDLfile treats ... as an identifier -- I don't think that will merge
      correctly
misc: validate.py and customize.py are getting pretty big -- should each
      module be split into a separate, er, module?
feat: Do something nicer with the validation error messages.  The desired
      goal is marking every form field that needs fixing.  Somehow.
DONE: Add pretty-printing for the choices file (the random ones are just
      jumbled together)
feat: Still need validation for all modules
bug:  Clean up the ????? stuff in the customization page, either by
      rewriting it or inserting them

[10/6/2006 sfd]

feat: Remove old sessions after some amount of time (days?)
DONE: Add a Reset button to all forms

[10/9/2006 sfd]

DONE: Add a link/button to download the choices file
bug:  Move the negative adverb to the sentential negation page?
bug:  Create reasonable friendly names for everything
bug:  Variable name harmonization

[10/11/2006 sfd]

bug:  Don't get confused by duplicated #corefs when merging TDL.  Also
      don't repeat them if they're identical (type names, too).
feat: In a TDL conj, sort to keep the type names first
feat: When printing the right side of a TDL typedef, indent any type names
      to the level of the :=, but indent the final [TFS] two spaces

[10/11/2006 sfd]

DONE: Something is wrong with omnisyndeton -- neither lexically- nor
      morphologically-marked strategies seem to be working.

[10/15/2006 erb]

feat: When adding seed strings, get their actual length and put it in
      `i-length' so we can manipulate by length in tsdb++
