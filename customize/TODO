[10/4/2006 sfd]

FEAT: Improve TDL pretty-printing
FEAT: Make TDLfile handle DOTTED.NAME.FORMAT correctly
BUG:  Fix layout oddities when the main-page dropdown buttons are clicked
      (by using images?)
BUG:  TDLfile treats ... as an identifier -- I don't think that will merge
      correctly
MISC: validate.py and customize.py are getting pretty big -- should each
      module be split into a separate, er, module?
FEAT: Do something nicer with the validation error messages.  The desired
      goal is marking every form field that needs fixing.  Somehow.
FEAT: Add pretty-printing for the choices file (the random ones are just
      jumbled together)
FEAT: Still need validation for all modules
BUG:  Clean up the ????? stuff in the customization page, either by
      rewriting it or inserting them

[10/6/2006 sfd]

FEAT: Remove old sessions after some amount of time (days?)
FEAT: Add a Reset button to all forms

[10/9/2006 sfd]

FEAT: Add a link/button to download the choices file
BUG:  Move the negative adverb to the sentential negation page?
BUG:  Create reasonable friendly names for everything
BUG:  Variable name harmoization

[10/11/06 erb]

FEAT: Figure out how to annotated seed strings with which harvester string
      their semantics should come from.  Reuse this information to write
      filters which are specific to certain MRSs.
