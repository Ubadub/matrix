Redundancy involving NON-FEMININE
NON-FEMININE: NEUTER is redundant - it is an ancestor of VEGETABLE 

Repairs:

Changed definition of gender hierarchy to relatively
flat, with fem and non-fem, the latter having subtypes
masc, neut, and veg.

Moved animacy out of gender and made it an "other feature"
with possible values "anim/inam".  

Changed number to sg/non-sg, with du and pl under non-sg.
Some elements specify non-sg, others du, nothing outside
of pronouns direclty says sg, nothing directly says pl.

Problem:

case slot can't take number slot as its input.  Tried fixing this by
adding possible input for noun-slot2 and ran into ?bug with
-lex-rule-dtr being inherited by noun-lex and the subtypes of
noun-lex.

Tried removing this:
  noun-slot1_opt=on

Still having the same error, so trying putting this one back
in and then having noun-slot2 only take noun-slot1 as input.

  noun-slot1_opt=on


also: not getting any parses of verbs without object markers
because subject marker slot isn't available as input for
tense marker.  (Or maybe because object marker isn't optional?)
Try making the tense marker take the subject marker as an
additional possible input, and run into same -lex-rule-dtr
bug.

Not sure why this is working now, but here's the current
state of affairs:

    verb-slot3_input1_type=verb-slot2
    verb-slot3_input2_type=verb-slot1

It doesn't make sense to make the object marker optional,
because it only applies to tverbs as input.

Next issue:

Missing lexical entry for ngiji/see.  Added like this:

    verb1_stem2_orth=ngiji
    verb1_stem2_pred=_see_v_rel


But that's still not enough. Tried making obj marker (which
apparently comes after the subject marker in these examples)
take subject marker rules as input, but that runs into problems
with the tense lex rules which don't want obj marker input.
... because of this:

    verb-slot3_input1_type=verb-slot2
    verb-slot3_input1_type=verb-slot1

changed to:

    verb-slot3_input1_type=verb-slot2
    verb-slot3_input2_type=verb-slot1

That fixed three errors, all on ungrammatical examples.  In fact,
all remaining errors are on ungrammatical examples, and the changes
noted above also increased ambiguity.  So maybe they are actually
regressions. *** Check this ***

Next issue:

-rni (and probably other case markers) weren't taking
pronouns as input.  Tried fixing like this:

    noun-slot2_input2_type=noun4
    noun-slot2_input3_type=noun5
    noun-slot2_input4_type=noun6
    noun-slot2_input5_type=noun7
    noun-slot2_input6_type=noun8
    noun-slot2_input7_type=noun9
    noun-slot2_input8_type=noun10
    noun-slot2_input9_type=noun11

Next issue:

Overgeneration of 1/2 subject agreement markers with
3rd person subjects.  The problem here is that the
common nouns weren't specified as third person in the
choices file.  Fixed like this (for each of noun1-3):

    noun1_feat2_name=pernum
    noun1_feat2_value=3rd

Resulting comptence figures:

Next issue:

There is spurious ambiguity in the current jig grammar because the
tense lexical rules can take the verb as a daughter directly.  This
looks like a customization bug (from the choices file, I don't think
this should happen).  In addition, however, the object markers are
effectively optional, and I don't think this is intended. The problem
is that the order, when both are present/overt is
subject-object-tense.  Since intransitives don't need object markers,
the tense rules have to be able to attach directly to subject markers
in the case of intransitive verbs.  BUT: With transitive verbs, the
object markers are presumably required.  (At least, I'm guessing so.
The ambiguity is arising because the third person objects are marked
with zeros...)

One solution is to make two sets of subject markers, one for
transitives and one for intransitives.  Then the tense marker rules
could attach to object markers or intranstive subject markers.  What I
do in the Wambaya grammar (not possible through the customization
system) is to put an zero-marked "intransitive" marker in the object
marker slot, requiring an empty COMPS list.

A complication, though, is some ungrammatical examples illustrating
incompatibility of 1st and 2nd person subject markers with certain
object markers.  I can't tell from the notes if this is because those
combinations of subjects and objects are just ineffable, or if "I see
you" would be expressed some other way.  If they are just ineffable,
it would be simple enough to say that the object markers also put some
constraints on the subjects of the verbs they attach to.  Another
solution is to make separate slots for the 1sg and 2nd subject markers
and have the object markers disallow them as input.

7/14/09: use "requires" and/or "other features" to let the object
marking rules select for the transitive verbs.  *** Interesting
interaction *** not yet considered in the customization system:
lexical rules that care about valence.  cf Wambaya TAM is sensitive to
png on subject & presence/absence of object.

7/29/09: "requires" didn't work because you can't select verb
stem classes in that way (it seems), but "other features" seems to
have worked.  I don't know why I didn't check in that version of the choices
file, but I'm doing so now.
