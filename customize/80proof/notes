Customized grammars from Safiyyah's choices files.
hau, kal, and mal don't validate (but no red stars).

First attempt at loading grammars.

Invalid type ACCUSATIVE
Unifications specified are invalid or do not unify
Type ACCUSATIVE-LEX-RULE has an invalid constraint specification
Invalid type NOMINATIVE
Unifications specified are invalid or do not unify
Type NOMINATIVE-LEX-RULE has an invalid constraint specification
Error: Problems in type file

Repairs:

Changed all instances of "nominative" to "nom" in choices
file, and all instances of "accusative" to "acc".  Then used
off-line customization system to create grammar.

Redundancy involving NON-FEMININE
NON-FEMININE: NEUTER is redundant - it is an ancestor of VEGETABLE 

Repairs:

Changed definition of gender hierarchy to relatively
flat, with fem and non-fem, the latter having subtypes
masc, neut, and veg.

Moved animacy out of gender and made it an "other feature"
with possible values "anim/inam".  

Changed number to sg/non-sg, with du and pl under non-sg.
Some elements specify non-sg, others du, nothing outside
of pronouns direclty says sg, nothing directly says pl.

Problem:

case slot can't take number slot as its input.  Tried fixing this by
adding possible input for noun-slot2 and ran into ?bug with
-lex-rule-dtr being inherited by noun-lex and the subtypes of
noun-lex.

Tried removing this:
  noun-slot1_opt=on

Still having the same error, so trying putting this one back
in and then having noun-slot2 only take noun-slot1 as input.

  noun-slot1_opt=on


also: not getting any parses of verbs without object markers
because subject marker slot isn't available as input for
tense marker.  (Or maybe because object marker isn't optional?)
Try making the tense marker take the subject marker as an
additional possible input, and run into same -lex-rule-dtr
bug.

Not sure why this is working now, but here's the current
state of affairs:

    verb-slot3_input1_type=verb-slot2
    verb-slot3_input2_type=verb-slot1

It doesn't make sense to make the object marker optional,
because it only applies to tverbs as input.

Cycle involving TRANSITIVE-VERB-LEX

Repairs:

Changed the following:


  verb1_name=transitive -> verb1_name=trans
  verb2_name=intransitive -> verb2_name=intrans

Next problem:

Error: pattern with no affixation ignored in NON-PRESENT-TENSE-PREFIX
Error: no valid morphological patterns in NON-PRESENT-TENSE-PREFIX: rule-ignored

The issue is that there is a slot with no morphemes defined
for it:

  verb-slot2_name=non-present-tense
  verb-slot2_order=before
    verb-slot2_input1_type=verb-slot6
  verb-slot3_name=remote-marker

Safiyyah explained that this was intended to house an empty
morpheme, so I added one.  Also added (per Safiyyah's instructions)
verb-slot3 and verb-slot4 as possible inputs to verb-slot6.

Now the grammar loads without errors!

Results:

Coverage: 0%

Repairs:

Added noun type for class 9 and stem for stick.
Fixed _n_rel on _sun_n_rel
