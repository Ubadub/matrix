Customized grammars from Safiyyah's choices files.
hau, kal, and mal don't validate (but no red stars).

First attempt at loading grammars.

Invalid type ACCUSATIVE
Unifications specified are invalid or do not unify
Type ACCUSATIVE-LEX-RULE has an invalid constraint specification
Invalid type NOMINATIVE
Unifications specified are invalid or do not unify
Type NOMINATIVE-LEX-RULE has an invalid constraint specification
Error: Problems in type file

Repairs:

Changed all instances of "nominative" to "nom" in choices
file, and all instances of "accusative" to "acc".  Then used
off-line customization system to create grammar.

Next problem:

      verb-slot6_morph1_feat1_name=aspect
      verb-slot6_morph1_feat1_value=mom-plus
      verb-slot6_morph1_feat1_head=verb

to this:

    verb-slot6_morph1_orth=-ku
      verb-slot6_morph1_feat1_name=aspect
      verb-slot6_morph1_feat1_value=mom-plus

Cycle involving TRANSITIVE-VERB-LEX

Repairs:

Changed the following:


  verb1_name=transitive -> verb1_name=trans
  verb2_name=intransitive -> verb2_name=intrans

Next problem:

Error: pattern with no affixation ignored in NON-PRESENT-TENSE-PREFIX
Error: no valid morphological patterns in NON-PRESENT-TENSE-PREFIX: rule-ignored

The issue is that there is a slot with no morphemes defined
for it:

  verb-slot2_name=non-present-tense
  verb-slot2_order=before
    verb-slot2_input1_type=verb-slot6
  verb-slot3_name=remote-marker
