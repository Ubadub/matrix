Customized grammars from Safiyyah's choices files.
hau, kal, and mal don't validate (but no red stars).

First attempt at loading grammars.

ute: 

Invalid type ACCUSATIVE
Unifications specified are invalid or do not unify
Type ACCUSATIVE-LEX-RULE has an invalid constraint specification
Invalid type NOMINATIVE
Unifications specified are invalid or do not unify
Type NOMINATIVE-LEX-RULE has an invalid constraint specification
Error: Problems in type file

Repairs:

Changed all instances of "nominative" to "nom" in choices
file, and all instances of "accusative" to "acc".  Then used
off-line customization system to create grammar.
