We might want to revine the NUMBER value for this example, if
the comment is accurate:

#Ex 24 illustrates agreement with a third person plural animate pronoun subject and a verb. For three or more, the suffix /-ka/ is added to verbs with both animate and inanimate subjects.  It precedes tense markers.  For animate subjects when /-ka/ is present the (non-sing) marker /-7um/ is optional.  Here it is given (Press 78).

Also, the example isn't parsing because of the form of
the non.sing suffix, which (I believe) is this rule:

Similarly, we might want to adjust the NUMBER value for

Here (#25) the problem seems to be that the result lex rule
doesn't want the plural obj lex rule as an input.

Try removing this:

  verb-slot10_opt=on

That didn't work (same effect---clearly a bug in the slot code).
Try the other way around: make verb-slot10 optional, and then have
anything that selects for verb-slot10 and verb-slot8 only select
verb-slot10.  That gives this:

... because the -dtr types are all subtypes of avm, but this change
leads to rules that are infl-add-only-no-ccont-lex-rule, which somehow
gets [DTR word-or-lexrule].  What that isn't a problem more of the time
is puzzling to me just now.  I think the fix (in general) is to have
the -rule-dtr types inherit from word-or-lexrule.  But fixing that by
hand still doesn't solve the problem with #25.

I'm coming to the conclusion that #25 is hopeless with the current
system, but would be open to ideas from others!

#Ex 40 illustrates a grammatical negative sentence.  The negative is usually formed by adding a negative suffix (wa7i)to the main verb. The negative marker /kacu/ may also appear in the clause.  The negative does not occur with the present tense marker /-jI/, but it does occur with the past tense marker /-vII/. Here the optional negative marker /kac/ is also used.  /kac/ can appear almost anywhere in the sentence as long as the constraints on other morphemes are satisfied (Press 99).  There was no discussion about a difference in meaning when /kac/ was included.  The only comment was that it was often left out in colloquial speech.  In the book, it is classified as an adverb.

#Ex 44 illustrates a grammatical yes/no question.  Yes-No questions are formed by adding the enclitic /-raa/ to the first word in the sentence.  Since this test suite does not model bound subjects, this means that the question enclitic will always attach to the subject in this test suite.  It is important to note that this is not truly always the case.  When attached pronouns are present, /-raa/ precedes them.  The past tense marker /-vII/ does not occur in questions (Press 85).

The grammar is analyzing this one as necessarily taking the inanimate
agreement marker (zero morph). Maybe what's really going on is
that there's a marked form which is only compatible with animates
and an unmarked form which is underspecified?  Try removing
this slot (and renaming slot10 slot9 throughout).

  verb-slot9_name=inanimate-subj-agreement
  verb-slot9_order=after
    verb-slot9_input1_type=verb-slot1
    verb-slot9_morph1_name=inanimate-subj-agreement-marker

      verb-slot9_morph1_feat1_value=inanimate
      verb-slot9_morph1_feat1_head=subj

Just doing that leaves nukwi-jI as uninflected.  Try making
the slots that take slot1 (-jI) as input optional.

  verb-slot7_opt=on

That saved 4 examples that weren't parsing before, but
added parses for 2 ungrammatical examples and made one
previously parsing example ambiguous.

One of the examples now parsing is this one:

#Ex 27 illustrates an ungrammatical use of the present tense for a [-mom] verb.  Press classifies verbs by a feature she calls momentaneous.  Verbs can be [-mom] "nukwi-run", [+mom] "tIrawi7i-dash off", or can take either aspectual meaning [*mom] "kwIhI-catch."  This feature constrains the tense/aspect suffixes that can attach to a verb.  The present tense suffix /-jI/ cannot attach to  [- mom] verbs.  Instead they take a zero suffix for present tense.  For [- mom] verbs the present tense suffix /-ji/ must be used for present tense, they cannot take the zero present tense marker (Press 64).

I can't understand the comment, though, regarding whether
this is supposed to have -ji, -jI, or -0 as a tense
marking suffix.

Here is other new overgeneration example:

#Ex 33 illustrates an ungrammatical use of one of the perfectives "finish".  It is formed by adding /-ma7aku/.  It occurs with with /-vII/-past and the perfective enclitic /-caa/ (Press 68). Here neither the perfective enclitic /-caa/ nor the past /-vII/ is used.

-caa is not defined.  -vII is slot1, which can take 4, 5, 8
or 9 as input. -ma7aku is slot 5, and marked optional. In the
parse, the example is going through the nom-mom-pres-lex rule,
which is also slot1.  So something should make non-mom-pres-lex
and -ma7aku incompatible. 

The extra parse for an ungrammatical example is this one:

#Ex 23 illustrates agreement with a third person plural animate pronoun subject and a verb. For three or more, the suffix /-ka/ is added to verbs with both animate and inanimate subjects.  It precedes tense markers.  For animate subjects when /-ka/ is present the (non-sing) marker /-7um/ is optional.  Here it is not given (Press 78).

Judgment: g
Phenomena: {agr,pn}
mam nukwikaj
mamI nukwi-ka-jI
3pl.anim.visible run-several-pres

And the culprit is apparently this morpheme:

    verb-slot2_morph3_name=underspecified
      verb-slot2_morph3_feat1_name=number
      verb-slot2_morph3_feat1_value=non-dual
      verb-slot2_morph3_feat1_head=subj
      verb-slot2_morph3_feat2_name=gender
      verb-slot2_morph3_feat2_value=animate
      verb-slot2_morph3_feat2_head=subj

I'm not sure what this is doing.  If slot2 is obligatory
(which it isn't currently) then it needs a catch-all
option that will pass through anything not covered
by the other morphs.  If it's optional, it shouldn't
have any zero morphs in it.  Trying deleting 
that morph for now to see what happens. 

Taking that out reduced the spurious ambiguity, without
any other changes.

This one isn't parsing because no tense marker is attached.
I think a zero morpheme (perhaps restricted to a certain
verb type) is missing from the tense-marker slot, but I can't
really tell what's going on from the comment.

#Ex 28 illustrates a grammatical use of the present tense for a [+mom] verb.  Press classifies verbs by a feature she calls momentaneous.  Verbs can be [-mom] "nukwi-run", [+mom] "tIrawi7i-dash off", or can take either aspectual meaning [*mom] "kwIhI-catch."  This feature constrains the tense/aspect suffixes that can attach to a verb.  The present tense suffix /-jI/ cannot attach to  [- mom] verbs.  Instead they take a zero suffix for present tense.  For [- mom] verbs the present tense suffix /-ji/ must be used for present tense, they cannot take the zero present tense marker (Press 64).

Here, the problem seems to be that the -ku rule is
ending up ltol, even though it is optional and not
the input for any other rule.  I think this is a bug
in the morphotactics code. A possible work-around is
to make it non-optional, and put a zero-morpheme in that
same slot with no effect.  I'll try that for now but
this is really not quite right :)

First attempt:

    verb-slot6_morph1_name=non-mom-zero-suffix
      verb-slot6_morph2_feat1_name=situation
      verb-slot6_morph2_feat1_value=mom-minus
      verb-slot6_morph2_feat1_head=verb

That doesn't help.  These two rules are still ltol,
which isn't the intended effect.

Next issue:

There is spurious ambiguity in the current jig grammar because the
tense lexical rules can take the verb as a daughter directly.  This
looks like a customization bug (from the choices file, I don't think
this should happen).  In addition, however, the object markers are
effectively optional, and I don't think this is intended. The problem
is that the order, when both are present/overt is
subject-object-tense.  Since intransitives don't need object markers,
the tense rules have to be able to attach directly to subject markers
in the case of intransitive verbs.  BUT: With transitive verbs, the
object markers are presumably required.  (At least, I'm guessing so.
The ambiguity is arising because the third person objects are marked
with zeros...)

One solution is to make two sets of subject markers, one for
transitives and one for intransitives.  Then the tense marker rules
could attach to object markers or intranstive subject markers.  What I
do in the Wambaya grammar (not possible through the customization
system) is to put an zero-marked "intransitive" marker in the object
marker slot, requiring an empty COMPS list.

A complication, though, is some ungrammatical examples illustrating
incompatibility of 1st and 2nd person subject markers with certain
object markers.  I can't tell from the notes if this is because those
combinations of subjects and objects are just ineffable, or if "I see
you" would be expressed some other way.  If they are just ineffable,
it would be simple enough to say that the object markers also put some
constraints on the subjects of the verbs they attach to.  Another
solution is to make separate slots for the 1sg and 2nd subject markers
and have the object markers disallow them as input.

7/14/09: use "requires" and/or "other features" to let the object
marking rules select for the transitive verbs.  *** Interesting
interaction *** not yet considered in the customization system:
lexical rules that care about valence.  cf Wambaya TAM is sensitive to
png on subject & presence/absence of object.

7/29/09: "requires" didn't work because you can't select verb
stem classes in that way (it seems), but "other features" seems to
have worked.  I don't know why I didn't check in that version of the choices
file, but I'm doing so now.

Coverage: 28.6%

Errors: 40/81



Found another lexical item that was missing
zaana intransitive _play_v_rel

Well-formed and 0 parses: 12

11 of these grammatical items that are not parsing are not expected to
parse given the current system.

Examples 2 and 3 demonstrate OSV and SOV word orders which are
possible in addition to the standard SVO.

Examples 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 demonstrate subject dropping.  The
reference grammar stated that overt pronouns are always emphatic.
Pro-drop is normal, so I did not include pronouns in the test suite.
(Maybe this should be done for the next go round)

Examples 37 and 40 have non-standard SOV word order to demonstrate the
object marker Object markers do not occur if the direct object follows
the verb.

Example 49 was mistakenly labeled as grammatical it was meant to be an
ungrammatical example demonstrating that the both the main verb and
auxliary require subject markers . I changed this in the test-suite
and made a new item file and placed it in tsdb/skeletons/nyn.

Example 66 demonstrates a form of coordination that the system does not do

Example 50 is the only that that I think the system should be able to
handle. The problem is that for the perfect both the aux and the main
verb must be marked for subject.  The way that the rules are currently
set up the main verb is being marked for univ-present and the aux is
marked for continuous-present. I am going to change the rules so that
there is one lexeme-to-word rule which will only apply to something
that has the modified form or yesterday-past-tense.

Running the grammar again and actually doing interactive unification
instead of guessing at the problem.  It seems that the aux is not able
to take the cont.pres because it conflicts with the perfective.

Coverage 33%
Overgeneration 3.7 %

Realized that negation morpheme had not been added.  This will account
for some of the errors.

EB:

Changed inputs for verb-slot4 from this:

	verb-slot4_input1_type=iverb
	verb-slot4_input2_type=tverb
	
to this:

	verb-slot4_input1_type=verb
	verb-slot4_input2_type=verb-slot5

My thinking was that "any verb" (i.e. just verb) would be less
likely to have the extra supertype problem, and that verb-slot5 was
motiviated in parallelism to the remote past marker. This results
in a grammar that loads (yay!) and has the same coverage/overgeneration
as above.

   
Looking now at the ones with errors that are well-formed.
There are 7 of these: 17, 19, 21, 54, 58, 63, 74.

17 at least was having a problem because the lkb was 
splitting +voice on +.  Changed in choices and item. But
that didn't fix anything since the +voice affix was a
clause-final question marker functioning as an affix.
To consider: Should we call it syntactically a clitic and
break it off?  Will try that way for now. Changing it back
to +voice so that the lkb segments it off, and then adding
it as a sentence final question marking particle.  That's
actually what the choices file had, except that the qpart
was spelling +voice instead of voice. ... But that's not
good enough, because the item file has -+voice, so I need
to get rid of that hyphen.

... and there's a lot of ambiguity.  None was added from
the previous state (except that the two new examples are
7 ways ambiguous).

Added negative morpheme:

    verb-slot1_morph4_name=neg-present
    verb-slot1_morph4_orth=ti-
      verb-slot1_morph4_feat1_name=tense
      verb-slot1_morph4_feat1_value=present
      verb-slot1_morph4_feat1_head=verb
      verb-slot1_morph4_feat2_name=aspect
      verb-slot1_morph4_feat2_value=habitual
      verb-slot1_morph4_feat2_head=verb
      verb-slot1_morph4_feat3_name=negation
      verb-slot1_morph4_feat3_value=plus
      verb-slot1_morph4_feat3_head=verb

That fixes at least one negative example, but leads
to surprising extra ambiguity on other examples.  

The problem seems to be that as soon as I put a negative
morpheme in that slot, the whole thing becomes cont-change-only-lex-rule,
and then things are underconstrained.  This is a bug in the 
way negation was retrofitted to the lex rules code, but the
work around (I think) is to define a separate slot for
the negative morpheme.  That took it back to the original
ambiguity level.

  verb-slot7_name=neg-present
  verb-slot7_order=before
    verb-slot7_input1_type=verb-slot6
    verb-slot7_morph1_name=neg-pres

This one isn't parsing because we don't have -riku-:

#Ex 58 demonstrates negation of the present continuous tense.  It is formed by prefixing "ti-" before the subject prefix and infixing "-riku-" between the subject prefix and the verb stem.

'The man is not singing.'
 
Remove aspect info from ti-, then have a slot before the
subject marker that ti requires which gives the aspect
info. Zero morpheme there gives habitual for "universal".
In fact, I think "ti-" doesn't carry any tense information:

#Ex 63 demonstrates negation of the remote past.  It is formed by prefixing "ti-" before the subject prefix, adding "-ra-" after the subject prefix, and attaching all of this to the modified form of the verb.

First attempt:

      verb-slot8_morph1_feat2_value=habitual
      verb-slot8_morph1_feat2_head=verb
    verb-slot8_morph2_name=neg-pres-cont
    verb-slot8_morph2_orth=riku-
      verb-slot8_morph2_feat1_name=tense
      verb-slot8_morph2_feat1_value=present
      verb-slot8_morph2_feat1_head=verb
      verb-slot8_morph2_feat2_name=aspect
      verb-slot8_morph2_feat2_value=continuous
      verb-slot8_morph2_feat2_head=verb
    verb-slot8_morph3_name=neg-past
    verb-slot8_morph3_orth=ra-
      verb-slot8_morph3_feat1_name=tense
      verb-slot8_morph3_feat1_value=remote-past
      verb-slot8_morph3_feat1_head=verb
    verb-slot8_constraint1_type=forces
    verb-slot8_constraint1_other-slot=verb-slot7

I've got the negative morpheme and the negated tense morphemes
mutually selecting each other.  Not sure how to require the -ire
bit in the past tense example.  What happens if two alternative
slots are required by the same morpheme?

Also had to add:

    verb-slot6_input3_type=verb-slot8


.. and that gave me a redundancy on main-verb-lex, since
it also got subj-marker-rule-dtr.  This is probably a morphotactics
bug.

Try changing this:

    verb-slot8_input1_type=tverb
    verb-slot8_input1_type=iverb

To this:

    verb-slot8_input1_type=verb

That gave a new morphotactics bug:

Error in GLBTYPE5:

Here the problem is that neg-tense-lex-rule is wtol, but
verb-lex is [INFLECTED -].  Maybe this is because of the mutual
selection thing that I was doing.  I'll try doing just one.

Removing this:

    verb-slot7_constraint1_type=req
    verb-slot7_constraint1_other-slot=verb-slot8

Same problem.  Try removing the other one:

    verb-slot8_constraint1_type=forces
    verb-slot8_constraint1_other-slot=verb-slot7

That loads... and fixes the -riku- example, but not
the -ra- example.  It also adds ambiguity to 7 other
sentences, while reducing ambiguity on 1.

The problem here is that teh neg-past morpheme can't
appear after the -ire slot.  Try making a separate slot
for -ra- which takes -ire as its input, and is also required
by ti-:

    verb-slot7_constraint2_type=req
    verb-slot7_constraint2_other-slot=verb-slot9
  verb-slot9_name=neg-past-tense
  verb-slot9_order=before
    verb-slot9_input1_type=verb-slot4
    verb-slot9_morph1_name=neg-past
    verb-slot9_morph1_orth=ra-
      verb-slot9_morph1_feat1_name=tense
      verb-slot9_morph1_feat1_value=remote-past
      verb-slot9_morph1_feat1_head=verb

    verb-slot6_input4_type=verb-slot9

No it's not an error, but it still doesn't parse.

The problem is that there are only two -ire morphemes currently.
One is non-finite, and the other is yesterday past.  It seems
that we need one more that is finite, and requires the -ra-
prefix. Try adding:

  verb-slot10_name=remote-past-neg
  verb-slot10_order=after
    verb-slot10_input1_type=verb
    verb-slot10_input2_type=verb-slot5
    verb-slot10_morph1_name=remote-past-ire
    verb-slot10_morph1_orth=-ire
    verb-slot10_constraint1_type=req
    verb-slot10_constraint1_other-slot=verb-slot9

    verb-slot9_input1_type=verb-slot10

That loads, but won't parse, because of a conflict
on the TRACK feature.  Try taking these out:

    verb-slot10_constraint1_type=req
    verb-slot10_constraint1_other-slot=verb-slot9


That added one, and killed off a lot of spurious ambiguity,
but also lost 4 items: 28, 34, 43, 44.  The problem
seems to be that the changes above had the side effect
of making present-tense-marker-rule ltol (slot 1), even
though it seems like it ought to be independent.  Submitting
this as another morphotactics bug.  Confirming by taking
this back out:

  verb-slot10_name=remote-past-neg
  verb-slot10_order=after
    verb-slot10_input1_type=verb
    verb-slot10_input2_type=verb-slot5
    verb-slot10_morph1_name=remote-past-ire
    verb-slot10_morph1_orth=-ire

And reverting this:

    verb-slot9_input1_type=verb-slot10
to this:

    verb-slot9_input1_type=verb-slot4

Leaving it like that for now, since the overall coverage is
better.


At least some of the over generation has to do with the
dependency between the negative prefix and the 
negative tense markers.  I'm geting neg-pres-tense-lex
without ti-, and since it's a zero, it comes up optionally
in any present tense form.  Putting this back in leads
to a grammar that won't load:

    verb-slot8_constraint1_type=forces
    verb-slot8_constraint1_other-slot=verb-slot7

That only accounts for 1 of the 8 parses, though.  The
others seem to have to do with all of the non-Xtense-lex
rules.  Turning that over to Safiyyah.

There seems to be two problems with this one:

boy NEG he-cont repair-CForm bicycle
The boy is not repairing a bicycle.


First, baa elsewhere is bàa. Second, there is
no auxiliary ya.  Maybe it was supposed to be
'yaa'.  It looks to me like this example is testing
phonology we don't handle.  Would it make sense to
have the morpheme segmented line regularize further?

SS--I began by looking at the first item that was coded as grammatical 
and did not parse.  I did a TSQL query in tsdb looking at well-formed and unanalyzed
items.

Example 1
yaaròo ya-nàa gyaarà-CForm kèekè
boy he-cont repair-CForm bicycle
The boy is repairing a bicycle.


I think that the problem is that "ya-" was coded as 2nd in the choices file.  It
should be 3rd.  I changed

verb-slot2_morph4_orth=ya-
      verb-slot2_morph4_feat2_value=2nd to

verb-slot2_morph4_orth=ya-

At first I thought this was happening because of 

neg-order=either

I changed it to neg-order=before and the problem still happened.

Now, I think this is overgenerating because the way the grammar is written the 
rule says it is allowed to come before a VP
"gyaarà kèekè" is a VP.  I do not know how to constrict it so that it only comes
before the aux.

Item 35 was partially not parsing because of a spelling convention.  If the weak
subject pronoun comes after the tense/aspect/mood aux, the convention is to write
them as two separate words.  Since we are regularizing spelling I changed this in
the test suite.  I also needed to add the suffix to the choices file (the other wsps
were prefixes.  This one is a suffix)

Trying to fix the problems with Ex 71, 66, 69, 70, I removed the second morpheme -aaRE-uNTe from the faked-tense-aspect-marker slot and created a new slot for it that takes any verb as an input.  The new grammar has slightly improved coverage.

The problem with 3SING-LEX-RULE was several morphs with the name value
"3sing", which despite belonging to different slots, ended up getting
defined as the same type.

    verb-slot1_morph1_name=3sing
    verb-slot2_morph1_name=3sing
    verb-slot3_morph1_name=3sing
    verb-slot4_morph1_name=3sing
    verb-slot11_morph1_name=3sing

The problem with aorist was (apparently) that it had
no supertype declared, which led to the system not defining
it in the tdl at all:

section=tense-aspect
tense-definition=build
  tense1_name=present
    tense1_supertype1_name=tense
  tense2_name=aorist
  tense3_name=past
    tense3_supertype1_name=tense
  aspect1_name=indefinite
    aspect1_supertype1_name=aspect
  aspect2_name=habitual
    aspect2_supertype1_name=aspect

Added:

    tense2_supertype1_name=tense

Now the grmmar loads, but I get these warnings:

These warnings are because the irules.tdl file contains duplicate
entries for each of the above rules.  The entries are exact
duplicates, so there is no harm done wrt to parsing, but it is
definitely a bug somewhere.

Not parsing, because the indefinite suffix isn't defined.
But the definite prefix is.  So maybe we can do an indefinite
suffix, even if we can't get the meaning quite right.

The boy sees the girl regularly.

While chasing down this one, I noticed that this rule doesn't
have any featural content:  

  verb-slot6_order=after
    verb-slot6_input1_type=verb2
    verb-slot6_input2_type=verb3
    verb-slot6_morph1_name=habitual-aspect-marker
    verb-slot6_morph1_orth=-la

It should probably constrain the aspect, at least!

The problem with #15 seems to be that the aspect marker won't
take the obj marker as an input, and the subj marker won't take
the aspect marker as an input.  Try this:

  verb-slot6_name=aspect-marker
  verb-slot6_opt=on
  verb-slot6_order=after
    verb-slot6_input1_type=verb-slot1
    verb-slot6_input2_type=verb-slot2
    verb-slot6_input3_type=verb-slot3
    verb-slot6_input4_type=verb-slot4
    verb-slot6_morph1_name=habitual-aspect-marker
    verb-slot6_morph1_orth=-la

Output now parses twice.

Trying with aspect information:

  verb-slot6_name=aspect-marker
  verb-slot6_opt=on
  verb-slot6_order=after
    verb-slot6_input1_type=verb-slot1
    verb-slot6_input2_type=verb-slot2
    verb-slot6_input3_type=verb-slot3
    verb-slot6_input4_type=verb-slot4
    verb-slot6_morph1_name=habitual-aspect-marker
    verb-slot6_morph1_orth=-la
    verb-slot6_morph1_feat1_name=aspect
    verb-slot6_morph1_feat1_value=habitual

That rescued ex #15, but also doubled the ambiguity just
about everywhere, so I think it's probably not quite right!

Backed out the change to check that that really happened (since
the 32 examples with increased ambiguity can't all involve
verb-slot6) and sure enough, it did.  I think there might be something
buggy here in the slot code, but maybe the problem was that
verb-slot6 was optional twice (with the opt check box and because
the other things could hop over it and get to 1,2,3,4).  That
combined with saying 1,2,3,4 instead of just 1,4 like verb-slot
5 might have done it.  Trying this now:

  verb-slot6_name=aspect-marker
  verb-slot6_order=after
    verb-slot6_input1_type=verb-slot1
    verb-slot6_input2_type=verb-slot2
    verb-slot6_input3_type=verb-slot3
    verb-slot6_input4_type=verb-slot4
    verb-slot6_morph1_name=habitual-aspect-marker
    verb-slot6_morph1_orth=-la
    verb-slot6_morph1_feat1_name=aspect
    verb-slot6_morph1_feat1_value=habitual

That gained one (#15) but lost two (#24, #35).

Next try:

  verb-slot6_name=aspect-marker
  verb-slot6_opt=on
  verb-slot6_order=after
    verb-slot6_input1_type=verb-slot1
    verb-slot6_input2_type=verb-slot4
    verb-slot6_morph1_name=habitual-aspect-marker
    verb-slot6_morph1_orth=-la
    verb-slot6_morph1_feat1_name=aspect
    verb-slot6_morph1_feat1_value=habitual

That worked (once I fixed a typo from input4 to input2).

The problem here is that the verb form is coming up as

The problem here seems to be that the lexical rule for the

I'm looking at the right lex rule, though, so passing this
one over to Safiyyah.

Looking at overgeneration cases now:

This will require some debugging of the lex rule dependencies,
I think. (#24 in [incr tsdb()]).

This one (#35 to [incr tsdb()]) seems to be related:
