Original choices file didn't load:

Changed   
	  verb1_name=transitive

to

New error:

We shouldn't be outputting such tdl :)  (Though this is a choices
file that doesn't pass validation; possibly this is why.)

Changed subj to obj on these:

      verb-slot4_morph9_feat3_head=obj

      verb-slot4_morph9_feat4_head=obj

New error:

Feature MOOD is introduced at multiple types (TAM PNG)

It looks like mood is basically just a reflection
of SF, so I removed the feature and replaced all 
references to it (other than those that end up with
just [MOOD mood]) with [QUESTION plus] and [QUESTION minus]
respectively.  In some cases, the QUESTION feature was
already being used.  This probably isn't going to get
the facts right for indicative markers (e.g., the
indicative negative marker), since I don't think we're
doing anything with [QUESTION minus].

All errors on items except 36, 47, 60, 63, and 66
concern ungrammatical items.  
Possibly expected errors, though this should be checked.

#Ex 36 demonstrates a yes-no question.  They are formed by using the interrogative mood inflection.  Some of the interrogative mood inflections are the same as the indicative inflections.

illit niri-riir-vi-t
you.sing eat-already-inter-2s
'Have you already eaten?'

If -riir is a tense/aspect marker, we should add
a rule for it.  If it's an incorporated adverb,
then I guess this one's hopeless.

Added 3pl(subj) 3s(obj) marker:

    verb-slot4_morph11_name=3p-3s-subj-obj-marker
    verb-slot4_morph11_orth=-at
      verb-slot4_morph11_feat1_name=number

      verb-slot4_morph11_feat2_name=person
      verb-slot4_morph11_feat2_value=3rd
      verb-slot4_morph11_feat2_head=subj
      verb-slot4_morph11_feat3_name=number

      verb-slot4_morph11_feat4_value=3rd
      verb-slot4_morph11_feat4_head=obj

But this one is still hopeless, because of non-retrofitted
coordination:

#Ex 47 demonstrates NP coordination. "Two NPs may be coordinated by enclitics "-lu" or "lunnitt" on the first constiuent of the last or on each NP in a stronger "both-and" or "either-or" sense" (a:126).

The note here doesn't make sense to me:

Maybe this was supposed to be ungrammatical for some other

Corrected spelling of 2pl pronoun from illissi to ilissi
(to be consistent with choices file and the rest of the
test suite).

... that's still not parsing, apparently because there is
no appropriate case rule for the plural pronoun.  The zero
marked form says that it is singular.  

#Ex 66 demonstrates subject-object-verb agreement.

illit puisit pisarvasi

This one has a singular subject and plural agreement
marking, so the grammar is apparently correctly ruling it
out.  Replace with correct grammatical example? Also add
correct grammatical example?  Also, the 2s pronoun should
be illit, not illi.

More error analysis:

#Ex 7  demonstrates that an intransitive verb takes a subject in the absolutive case.  (I am not confident that the top line shows the proper spelling according to source b, if a verb base ends in a consonant "p" is used instead of "v".) Vocabulary for "qimmiq/dog" and "qilut/bark" taken from a:280

The grammar thinks that qilut-vu-q is not fully inflected.  Apparently
the same problem with 10.
