We might want to revine the NUMBER value for this example, if
the comment is accurate:

#Ex 24 illustrates agreement with a third person plural animate pronoun subject and a verb. For three or more, the suffix /-ka/ is added to verbs with both animate and inanimate subjects.  It precedes tense markers.  For animate subjects when /-ka/ is present the (non-sing) marker /-7um/ is optional.  Here it is given (Press 78).

Also, the example isn't parsing because of the form of
the non.sing suffix, which (I believe) is this rule:

Similarly, we might want to adjust the NUMBER value for

Here (#25) the problem seems to be that the result lex rule
doesn't want the plural obj lex rule as an input.

Try removing this:

  verb-slot10_opt=on

That didn't work (same effect---clearly a bug in the slot code).
Try the other way around: make verb-slot10 optional, and then have
anything that selects for verb-slot10 and verb-slot8 only select
verb-slot10.  That gives this:

Type ASPECTUAL-MARKERS-LEX-RULE's constraint specification clashes with its parents'

... because the -dtr types are all subtypes of avm, but this change
leads to rules that are infl-add-only-no-ccont-lex-rule, which somehow
gets [DTR word-or-lexrule].  What that isn't a problem more of the time
is puzzling to me just now.  I think the fix (in general) is to have
the -rule-dtr types inherit from word-or-lexrule.  But fixing that by
hand still doesn't solve the problem with #25.

I'm coming to the conclusion that #25 is hopeless with the current
system, but would be open to ideas from others!

#Ex 40 illustrates a grammatical negative sentence.  The negative is usually formed by adding a negative suffix (wa7i)to the main verb. The negative marker /kacu/ may also appear in the clause.  The negative does not occur with the present tense marker /-jI/, but it does occur with the past tense marker /-vII/. Here the optional negative marker /kac/ is also used.  /kac/ can appear almost anywhere in the sentence as long as the constraints on other morphemes are satisfied (Press 99).  There was no discussion about a difference in meaning when /kac/ was included.  The only comment was that it was often left out in colloquial speech.  In the book, it is classified as an adverb.

#Ex 44 illustrates a grammatical yes/no question.  Yes-No questions are formed by adding the enclitic /-raa/ to the first word in the sentence.  Since this test suite does not model bound subjects, this means that the question enclitic will always attach to the subject in this test suite.  It is important to note that this is not truly always the case.  When attached pronouns are present, /-raa/ precedes them.  The past tense marker /-vII/ does not occur in questions (Press 85).

#Ex 52 illustrates grammatical NP coordination.  There are two ways to coordinate NPs /-gajaa/ is used when the two NPs are not considered to have engaged int the action together.

We might be able to handle #52 and 53, by calling
them N coordination (so that we can use the affix

is wrong in the glossing on #53.

The problem here is that -jI can't attach directly to the

is incompatible with the plural marker later.  Leaving this
one for Safiyyah, who hopefully has a better understanding
of this suffix system.

The grammar is analyzing this one as necessarily taking the inanimate
agreement marker (zero morph). Maybe what's really going on is
that there's a marked form which is only compatible with animates
and an unmarked form which is underspecified?  Try removing
this slot (and renaming slot10 slot9 throughout).

  verb-slot9_name=inanimate-subj-agreement
  verb-slot9_order=after
    verb-slot9_input1_type=verb-slot1
    verb-slot9_morph1_name=inanimate-subj-agreement-marker

      verb-slot9_morph1_feat1_value=inanimate
      verb-slot9_morph1_feat1_head=subj

Just doing that leaves nukwi-jI as uninflected.  Try making
the slots that take slot1 (-jI) as input optional.

  verb-slot2_opt=on
  verb-slot7_opt=on

That saved 4 examples that weren't parsing before, but
added parses for 2 ungrammatical examples and made one
previously parsing example ambiguous.

One of the examples now parsing is this one:

#Ex 27 illustrates an ungrammatical use of the present tense for a [-mom] verb.  Press classifies verbs by a feature she calls momentaneous.  Verbs can be [-mom] "nukwi-run", [+mom] "tIrawi7i-dash off", or can take either aspectual meaning [*mom] "kwIhI-catch."  This feature constrains the tense/aspect suffixes that can attach to a verb.  The present tense suffix /-jI/ cannot attach to  [- mom] verbs.  Instead they take a zero suffix for present tense.  For [- mom] verbs the present tense suffix /-ji/ must be used for present tense, they cannot take the zero present tense marker (Press 64).

I can't understand the comment, though, regarding whether
this is supposed to have -ji, -jI, or -0 as a tense
marking suffix.

Here is other new overgeneration example:

#Ex 33 illustrates an ungrammatical use of one of the perfectives "finish".  It is formed by adding /-ma7aku/.  It occurs with with /-vII/-past and the perfective enclitic /-caa/ (Press 68). Here neither the perfective enclitic /-caa/ nor the past /-vII/ is used.

maN nukwima7ak
maNa nukwi-ma7aku

-caa is not defined.  -vII is slot1, which can take 4, 5, 8
or 9 as input. -ma7aku is slot 5, and marked optional. In the
parse, the example is going through the nom-mom-pres-lex rule,
which is also slot1.  So something should make non-mom-pres-lex
and -ma7aku incompatible. 

The extra parse for an ungrammatical example is this one:

#Ex 23 illustrates agreement with a third person plural animate pronoun subject and a verb. For three or more, the suffix /-ka/ is added to verbs with both animate and inanimate subjects.  It precedes tense markers.  For animate subjects when /-ka/ is present the (non-sing) marker /-7um/ is optional.  Here it is not given (Press 78).

Judgment: g
Phenomena: {agr,pn}
mam nukwikaj
mamI nukwi-ka-jI
3pl.anim.visible run-several-pres
'They are running.'

And the culprit is apparently this morpheme:

    verb-slot2_morph3_name=underspecified
      verb-slot2_morph3_feat1_name=number
      verb-slot2_morph3_feat1_value=non-dual
      verb-slot2_morph3_feat1_head=subj
      verb-slot2_morph3_feat2_name=gender
      verb-slot2_morph3_feat2_value=animate
      verb-slot2_morph3_feat2_head=subj

I'm not sure what this is doing.  If slot2 is obligatory
(which it isn't currently) then it needs a catch-all
option that will pass through anything not covered
by the other morphs.  If it's optional, it shouldn't
have any zero morphs in it.  Trying deleting 
that morph for now to see what happens. 

Taking that out reduced the spurious ambiguity, without
any other changes.

This one isn't parsing because no tense marker is attached.
I think a zero morpheme (perhaps restricted to a certain
verb type) is missing from the tense-marker slot, but I can't
really tell what's going on from the comment.

#Ex 28 illustrates a grammatical use of the present tense for a [+mom] verb.  Press classifies verbs by a feature she calls momentaneous.  Verbs can be [-mom] "nukwi-run", [+mom] "tIrawi7i-dash off", or can take either aspectual meaning [*mom] "kwIhI-catch."  This feature constrains the tense/aspect suffixes that can attach to a verb.  The present tense suffix /-jI/ cannot attach to  [- mom] verbs.  Instead they take a zero suffix for present tense.  For [- mom] verbs the present tense suffix /-ji/ must be used for present tense, they cannot take the zero present tense marker (Press 64).

Here, the problem seems to be that the -ku rule is
ending up ltol, even though it is optional and not
the input for any other rule.  I think this is a bug
in the morphotactics code. A possible work-around is
to make it non-optional, and put a zero-morpheme in that
same slot with no effect.  I'll try that for now but
this is really not quite right :)

First attempt:

    verb-slot6_morph1_name=non-mom-zero-suffix
      verb-slot6_morph2_feat1_name=situation
      verb-slot6_morph2_feat1_value=mom-minus
      verb-slot6_morph2_feat1_head=verb

That doesn't help.  These two rules are still ltol,
which isn't the intended effect.

The problem here is that there apparently aren't

is just underspecified for number.  I'd define 
the slot, but I don't know where it goes, nor what
the plural morpheme looks like.

#Ex 11 illustrates an ungrammatical sentence where the inanimate subject takes the non-singular marker /-7umi/ for animate nouns.  This is used to mark two or more. Inanimate nouns are optionally marked for plurality do not combine with verbs that have the non-singular suffix.
