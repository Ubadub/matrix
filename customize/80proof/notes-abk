Initial choices file customizes but creates a grammar that
doesn't load:

Type AORIST-MARKER-LEX-RULE has an invalid constraint specification

Unifications specified are invalid or do not unify
Type AORIST-NEGATIVE-MARKER-LEX-RULE has an invalid constraint specification
Error: Problems in type file

The problem with 3SING-LEX-RULE was several morphs with the name value
"3sing", which despite belonging to different slots, ended up getting
defined as the same type.

    verb-slot1_morph1_name=3sing
    verb-slot2_morph1_name=3sing
    verb-slot3_morph1_name=3sing
    verb-slot4_morph1_name=3sing
    verb-slot11_morph1_name=3sing

The problem with aorist was (apparently) that it had
no supertype declared, which led to the system not defining
it in the tdl at all:

section=tense-aspect
tense-definition=build
  tense1_name=present
    tense1_supertype1_name=tense
  tense2_name=aorist
  tense3_name=past
    tense3_supertype1_name=tense
  aspect1_name=indefinite
    aspect1_supertype1_name=aspect
  aspect2_name=habitual
    aspect2_supertype1_name=aspect

Added:

    tense2_supertype1_name=tense

Now the grmmar loads, but I get these warnings:

WARNING: Rule `1SING-NON-ERG-SUBJ-MARKER-PREFIX' redefined.
WARNING: Rule `1PL-NON-ERG-SUBJ-MARKER-PREFIX' redefined.

WARNING: Rule `3PL-NON-ERG-SUBJ-MARKER-PREFIX' redefined.

These warnings are because the irules.tdl file contains duplicate
entries for each of the above rules.  The entries are exact
duplicates, so there is no harm done wrt to parsing, but it is
definitely a bug somewhere.

A boy saw the girl.

Not parsing, because the indefinite suffix isn't defined.
But the definite prefix is.  So maybe we can do an indefinite
suffix, even if we can't get the meaning quite right.

#Ex 15 demonstrates the  habitual aspect. It is formed by adding the suffix "-la" after the verb and before the tense marker

a-t͡ʂʰkʷʰən a-təpha də-jə-ba-la-wa-jt

The boy sees the girl regularly.

While chasing down this one, I noticed that this rule doesn't
have any featural content:  

  verb-slot6_order=after
    verb-slot6_input1_type=verb2
    verb-slot6_input2_type=verb3
    verb-slot6_morph1_name=habitual-aspect-marker
    verb-slot6_morph1_orth=-la

It should probably constrain the aspect, at least!

The problem with #15 seems to be that the aspect marker won't
take the obj marker as an input, and the subj marker won't take
the aspect marker as an input.  Try this:

  verb-slot6_name=aspect-marker
  verb-slot6_opt=on
  verb-slot6_order=after
    verb-slot6_input1_type=verb-slot1
    verb-slot6_input2_type=verb-slot2
    verb-slot6_input3_type=verb-slot3
    verb-slot6_input4_type=verb-slot4
    verb-slot6_morph1_name=habitual-aspect-marker
    verb-slot6_morph1_orth=-la

Output now parses twice.

Trying with aspect information:

  verb-slot6_name=aspect-marker
  verb-slot6_opt=on
  verb-slot6_order=after
    verb-slot6_input1_type=verb-slot1
    verb-slot6_input2_type=verb-slot2
    verb-slot6_input3_type=verb-slot3
    verb-slot6_input4_type=verb-slot4
    verb-slot6_morph1_name=habitual-aspect-marker
    verb-slot6_morph1_orth=-la
    verb-slot6_morph1_feat1_name=aspect
    verb-slot6_morph1_feat1_value=habitual

That rescued ex #15, but also doubled the ambiguity just
about everywhere, so I think it's probably not quite right!

Backed out the change to check that that really happened (since
the 32 examples with increased ambiguity can't all involve
verb-slot6) and sure enough, it did.  I think there might be something
buggy here in the slot code, but maybe the problem was that
verb-slot6 was optional twice (with the opt check box and because
the other things could hop over it and get to 1,2,3,4).  That
combined with saying 1,2,3,4 instead of just 1,4 like verb-slot
5 might have done it.  Trying this now:

  verb-slot6_name=aspect-marker
  verb-slot6_order=after
    verb-slot6_input1_type=verb-slot1
    verb-slot6_input2_type=verb-slot2
    verb-slot6_input3_type=verb-slot3
    verb-slot6_input4_type=verb-slot4
    verb-slot6_morph1_name=habitual-aspect-marker
    verb-slot6_morph1_orth=-la
    verb-slot6_morph1_feat1_name=aspect
    verb-slot6_morph1_feat1_value=habitual

That gained one (#15) but lost two (#24, #35).

Next try:

  verb-slot6_name=aspect-marker
  verb-slot6_opt=on
  verb-slot6_order=after
    verb-slot6_input1_type=verb-slot1
    verb-slot6_input2_type=verb-slot4
    verb-slot6_morph1_name=habitual-aspect-marker
    verb-slot6_morph1_orth=-la
    verb-slot6_morph1_feat1_name=aspect
    verb-slot6_morph1_feat1_value=habitual

That worked (once I fixed a typo from input4 to input2).

The problem here is that the verb form is coming up as
[INFLECTED -].  I suspect this might have something to
do with the unusual order of affixes noted in the comment.

The problem here seems to be that the lexical rule for the
prefix won't take a stative verb as an input.  I'm not sure
I'm looking at the right lex rule, though, so passing this
one over to Safiyyah.

Looking at overgeneration cases now:

#Ex 23 demonstrates an ungrammatical use of the aorist tense.  The aorist tense has a zero marker that comes before the dynamic/finite marker.  Here the dynamic/finite marker is missing.

This will require some debugging of the lex rule dependencies,
I think. (#24 in [incr tsdb()]).

This one (#35 to [incr tsdb()]) seems to be related:

This one was because the morph was underconstrained:

Now 50 (aka 52) no longer parses.  (only one of those was relevant
in this case, but they all needed it ;)
