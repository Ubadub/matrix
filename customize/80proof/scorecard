NB: correct failures presents the total of ungrammatical sentences that
are not parsed for the correct reasons (i.e. excluding overgeneration and those that do not parse for the wrong reasons). The number in parentheses represents how many not parsed ungrammatical sentences are not parsing for the right reasons.
