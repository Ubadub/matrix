Choices file doesn't validate, but doesn't leave any red stars.
Trying customize-one.py led to the system spinning.

Problem was disjunctive gender value on noun12: inanimate, non-rational.
Changed that to just inanimate, and got a grammar that loaded, but
with a cycle on non-rational, because noun10 still had that disjunctive
value.  Change that to just inanimate, and got on to next problem.

Cycle involving NOM-ACC-TRANSITIVE-VERB-LEX

Changed:

  verb1_name=nom-acc-transitive

to:

  verb1_name=nom-acc-trans

... and made similar changes for all the verb type names.

Grammar loads!

#56 not parsing because coordination is
not fully retrofitted to new morphotactics. In particular,
infl-bottom-coord-rule requires that the daughter be
[INFLECTED -], but the daughter in this case has
gone through a lexeme-to-word-rule.  

Added stem for "fall":

    verb2_stem2_orth=viiZ
    verb2_stem2_pred=_fall_v_rel

#58, 59 don't parse because affix-marked coordination
is not supported for phrases (NP, VP, S)

Something very puzzling here:

TSNLP(3): (lkb::do-parse-tty "atE cirikk-tu")
Error: 
Rule PAST_VERB returned from morph analyser is undefined (error in grammar
       loading?)

There is nothing called "past_verb" anywhere in the
.tdl, so I have now idea how the morph analyzer is getting
that. Even tried restarting the LKB to make sure it
wasn't left over from some other grammar.

Found the culprit: We'd left in an irregs.tab file initalized
with an example from English:

"
ate PAST_VERB eat
"

Not sure if it's legit to remove this or not.

Problem with this example:

kuTTi amma-e viLi-ccu
child.nom mother-acc call-past
The child called the mother.


appears to be that the past tense rule is ltol, i.e.,
viLi-ccu is [INFLECTED -].

Fixed that by making verb-slot4 and verb-slot5 (negation
markers) optional.

  verb-slot4_opt=on
  verb-slot5_opt=on

That seems to have introduced a new error for this example (#65):

kuTTi cirikk-uka-aaNe-irunnu
child.nom laugh-infinitive-imperfect-past
'The child was laughing.'

Item 14 wasn't parsing and furthermore was getting subj-head
and comp-head attachment for subject of intransitive verb.
Changed this:

  verb4_valence=trans

to this:

  verb4_valence=intrans

Two ungrammatical examples parsing:

#Ex 36 demonstrates an ungrammatical use of tense.  Here the verb appears without the tense marker.
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: {tam}
kuTTi cirikk
kuTTi cirikk
child.nom laugh
'The child laughs.'

--> The problem here is a bug in the morphotactics that
lead to tense-aspect-rule-dtr being a supertype of verb-lex,
despite nothing in the choices file indicating that.

#Ex 71 demonstrates ungrammatical present habitual.  It is formed by adding "-aaRE" and "-uNTE" to the verb stem.  Here they are attached to the present tense stem.
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: {tam}
kuTTi cirikkunnaaRuNTaayirunnu
kuTTi cirikk-unnu-aaRE-uNTE
child.nom laugh-pres-hab-hab.pres
'The child was laughing.'

--> This one we might be able to fix, since there
seem to be two ways of doing -aaRe-uNTe, all at once
or in two pieces.

SS--I loaded the grammar and received an error for the imperfective-marker-rule.  The error stated there was a strange character.  I checked irules.tdl and noticed an
extra space.  I removed the space and reloaded the grammar without errors.

Trying to fix the problems with Ex 71, 66, 69, 70, I removed the second morpheme -aaRE-uNTe from the faked-tense-aspect-marker slot and created a new slot for it that takes any verb as an input.  The new grammar has slightly improved coverage.

Coverage 79.5%
Overgeneration 2.7%

Ex 71 was eliminated
Ex 66 parsed

I think that the problem with #69 and #70 is that I did not update the tense-aspect 
slot to have the new slot as input.

Coverage 84.6%
Overgeneration 2.7%

I think that this is the most that we will be able to do.
