Label "Blake (2001) defines <span style=\"font-variant:small-caps\">case</span> as &quot;a system of marking dependent nouns for the type of relationship they bear to their heads.&quot; For example, case commonly marks the subject or the direct object of a verb. The marking might consist of affixation or some other morpholological process that marks words, or it might be a adposition that marks whole noun phrases."
Label "This questionnaire allows you to describe <span style=\"font-variant:small-caps\">core case marking</span> in your language; that is, the pattern of cases marking the mandatory arguments of transitive and intransitive verbs.  Following Dixon (1968), we refer to the grammatical relations commonly expressed by case using the following abbreviations: A refers to the agent of a transitive verb; O refers to the patient (or object) of a transitive verb; and S refers to the lone argument (or subject) of intransitive verbs."
