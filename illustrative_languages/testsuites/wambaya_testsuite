# Simultaneous and because clauses are always finite. There is no subj sharing
# Because there is no subordiator, should I even include this? She calls these 
# "adjoined clauses as adjuncts to the main clause." I'm not convinced that this
# isn't juxtaposition. If I do include it, these sentences can be while or because
# so I'll need two strategies (one to add each predication)

# Prior and purposive clauses are non-finite and have a particular suffix.
# TODO: Is the subject necessarily shared? It is for purposive- need to confirm for prior
# Transitive verbs require a special case on the object. For these, the grammatical sentence is expected to fail until
# valence change rules can account for this. The ungrammatical sentence with the standard (absolutive) case on the
# object is expected to parse.
