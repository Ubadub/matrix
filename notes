Bickel et al have separate toolbox entries for the bipartite-stem
prefixes, and then link to them via the \bip field.  Don't know how
general this is.

For now I am entering the toolbox tags with the leading \.  If I
insist on this, validation should check for it.

Need to work out how to segment file into sequence of entries, since
\id doesn't come first.

Questionnaire todos:
--- Make buttons work
--- Make drop downs for lexical types work.
--- Need valiation on import lexicon page, including
errors for not specifying the lexical type.

Output desiderata: should give counts of each import class
that matched, plus count of unmatched entries in Toolbox lexicon.

Need to validate for case where lexical entries are imported
into some lexical class and then that class is deleted.

Need to validate that lexical class chosen specifies
a bipartite-stem-pc if the imported entries have bipartite-stems.
When does this validation happen?  Maybe after import lexicon?

How to get the uniq numbering of pred values to cover these
ones too?  Question for David.

For now we're only doing nouns and verbs through import, so
only those types should show up in the dropdowns.

Next steps:

/ Write choices file to temporary file (for dev purposes)
/ Write function that integrates imported entries and try
customizing with them.
* Debug customization with integrated lex entries
(data/choice2-w-imports)
* Fix handling of bistems: right now I'm just getting
numbers, but in fact we need to go back through the file and
pull out the spelling of the affix from that number.
* Write funciton that will actually be called by import
lexicon button that updates choices file with new info.
(Including deleting the old imported entries first.)
* Write test, in two steps:
  --- Separate test(s) called by regression test scripts that
  invokes import_toolbox_lexicon with (stored) choices file
  and db.
  --- Output of that is a choices file which is either put
  into regression_tests/choices and then run as a regular regression
  test or diffed against regression_tests/choices file stored there.
* Validation

Bookmark:

python matrix.py -C gmcs/ c data/choices2 
... does not give errors

but

python matrix.py -C gmcs/ c data/choices2-w-imports

has problems in get_type_covering wiht KeyError: '1du_incl'.
This must have something to do with modifying the choices
file, but I can't see what yet.
