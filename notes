1. store uniqid in name, and get rid of extra calls to uniqid
   -- Storing in name works, but I think I still need to look up
   bistems via uniqid/name until I can print them with the rest of
   the lexicon file.
2. see if that fixes any identified bugs
   -- not so far.
2'. other debugging
3. name hallucinated lex rules (making sure the name values are unique)
4. name all lex entries (making sure names are unique in that space) and then make lexicon tdlfile merge by default
   	-- printing of lexicon should follow both customize_lexicon and customiz_lexrules
5. if that works, remove code for the non-merge case

Identified bugs:
1. Whole INFLECTED value is copied up on the bps affix rule type.
2. Dtr types are overapplied, such that intermediate lex rule can be skipped.  Might be mutual requires but, might be same as ticket #601.
3. Not getting na-or-- type initial values.
