Bickel et al have separate toolbox entries for the bipartite-stem
prefixes, and then link to them via the \bip field.  Don't know how
general this is.

For now I am entering the toolbox tags with the leading \.  If I
insist on this, validation should check for it.

Need to work out how to segment file into sequence of entries, since
\id doesn't come first.

Questionnaire todos:
--- Make buttons work
--- Make drop downs for lexical types work.
--- Need valiation on import lexicon page, including
errors for not specifying the lexical type.

Output desiderata: should give counts of each import class
that matched, plus count of unmatched entries in Toolbox lexicon.

Need to validate for case where lexical entries are imported
into some lexical class and then that class is deleted.

Need to validate that lexical class chosen specifies
a bipartite-stem-pc if the imported entries have bipartite-stems.
When does this validation happen?  Maybe after import lexicon?

How to get the uniq numbering of pred values to cover these
ones too?  Question for David.

For now we're only doing nouns and verbs through import, so
only those types should show up in the dropdowns.
