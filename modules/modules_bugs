Description of coordination strategies: "the coordinand"

If aux info is filled out, make aux even if not need for neg/q

globals.lsp and hyphens

instance identifiers can't contain . or :, but script
uses orthography to make them for lexical items, and the
orthography may contain those characters.

got a bare np phrase anyway.  Are we just assuming that all
languages want it?  (Neither of the nouns can go through it
in this grammar, but the phrase is there.)

Change comment in irules.tdl to specify spelling *changing*
lexical rules, rather than spelling preserving.
