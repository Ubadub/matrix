Notes:

--- Need to know actual noun class for car.  Could be 5/6 as
well as 9/10.  Likewise, cat (guessing 5/6, from ili-kati form
in dictionary.)
--- What is the correct form of the proximal demonstrative adjective
for 'dogs'?
--- What would the actual present tense forms look like?
--- What happens on the verb agreement when the subject or argument
is a coordinated NP with heterogeneous noun classes?
